## Overview  
PlayPulse is a **virtual controller system** that transforms a user’s phone into a customizable gamepad, connecting it to a web or TV screen through **WebRTC and WebSockets** for low-latency responsiveness.  

Its architecture leverages:  
- **React + TypeScript** for frontend interactions  
- **React Native** for mobile companion app  
- **Node.js (Express)** for signaling + API  
- **MongoDB** for layout and session storage  
- **Firebase** for push notifications  
- **WebRTC + WebSockets** for real-time connectivity

## Why Use PlayPulse  
Traditional game controllers are expensive and often platform-specific. PlayPulse offers:  

1. **Accessibility** → Turn any smartphone into a controller.  
2. **Flexibility** → Custom layouts for different genres.  
3. **Low-Cost Setup** → No need for proprietary hardware.  
4. **Developer-Friendly** → SDK integration for rapid adoption.  
5. **Cross-Platform Reach** → Works with web, TV, and mobile games.  

---

## Target Users  
- **Indie Developers** → Provide accessible controller solutions for browser-based games.  
- **Gamers** → Use any phone as a controller without extra hardware.  
- **Educators** → Teach interactive systems and networking concepts.  
- **Startups** → Prototype interactive TV/gameplay platforms quickly.  

---

## How It Works  
1. **Pairing** → The mobile device scans a QR code or enters a session code.  
2. **Connection Setup** → WebRTC establishes peer-to-peer input streaming.  
3. **Session Management** → Node.js backend manages session states in MongoDB.  
4. **Input Handling** → Mobile sends input events; React frontend receives and maps them.  
5. **Feedback Loop** → Game events trigger haptic responses on the mobile device.  

---

## Use Cases  
- **Party Games** → Multiple phones connected to a shared screen.  
- **Prototype Testing** → Rapidly build and test controller-driven mechanics.  
- **Remote Play** → Allow players to connect from anywhere.  
- **Interactive Experiences** → Extend beyond gaming into education and events.

## Future Plans  
1. **Multi-Device Co-op Support** for simultaneous play.  
2. **Cloud-Synced Layouts** so users can store and reuse custom controllers.  
3. **AR/VR Extensions** to expand interactivity.  
4. **Game Analytics Integration** for developer insights.
